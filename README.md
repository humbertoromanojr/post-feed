## Important notice

Estava fazendo o projeto Post-feeds somente em Javascript, e j√° tinha 42 commits contendo toda a sua hit√≥ria de desenvolvimento, depois criei o projeto Post-feeds-ts para fazer a migra√ß√£o para usar Typescript usando o mesmo reposit√≥rio remoto, e com isso eu apaguei sem querer todos os 42 commits anteriores. Venho com este coment√°rio, para voc√™s n√£o repetir o mesmo erro meu. Fa√ßam em projetos separados ou juntos dessa forma,que fica melhor para outros poderem seguir.

I was doing the Post-feeds project only in Javascript, and I already had 42 commits containing all its development history, then I created the Post-feeds-ts project to migrate to use Typescript using the same remote repository, and with that I accidentally deleted all 42 previous commits. I come with this comment, so you don't repeat my same mistake. Do it in separate projects or together that way, which is better for others to follow.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
